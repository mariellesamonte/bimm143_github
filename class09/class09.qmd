Today we will take a step back to some data we can taste and explore the correlation structure and principal components of some Halloween candy.

## 1. Data import

```{r}
candy_file <- "candy-data.txt"
candy <- read.csv(candy_file, row.names=1)
head(candy)
```
> Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset?

```{r}
nrow(candy)
```

> Q2. How many fruity candy types are in the dataset?

```{r}
sum(candy$fruity)
```

## 2. What is your favorite candy?

`winpercent` is the percentage of people who prefer this candy over another randomly chosen candy from the dataset. The higher the percentage, the more popular the candy is. 

> Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it’s winpercent value?

```{r}
candy["Sour Patch Kids",]$winpercent
```

> Q4. What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?

```{r}
candy["Kit Kat",]$winpercent
```

> Q5. What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?

```{r}
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars",]$winpercent
```

### Exploratory Analysis

There is a useful `skim()` function in the **skimr** package that can help give a quick overview of a given dataset, especially when you encounter a new dataset.

```{r}
library("skimr")
skim(candy)
```


> Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

The `candy$winpercent` variable in the last column seems to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset.

> Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy$chocolate column?

```{r}
candy$chocolate
```
Going down the list of 85 candy, zero represents that the candy does not fit the chocolate category, while 1 means that the candy fits the chocolate category.

> Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

```{r}
hist(candy$winpercent)

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 10, fill = "dark red")
```

> Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

The distribution of winpercent values is not symmetrical.

> Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

```{r}
summary(candy$winpercent)
```

The median is below 50%, 47.83

> Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

```{r}
choc.inds <- candy$chocolate == 1
choc.candy <- candy[choc.inds, ]
choc.win <- choc.candy$winpercent
mean(choc.win)

fruit.inds <- candy$fruity == 1
fruit.candy <- candy[fruit.inds, ]
fruit.win <- fruit.candy$winpercent
mean(fruit.win)
```

Chocolate candy is ranked higher (60.9) than fruit candy (44.1) on average.

> Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

```{r}
t.test(choc.win, fruit.win)
ans <- t.test(choc.win, fruit.win)
ans$p.value
```
The difference is statistically significant, demonstrated by low p-value = 2.871e-08.
Yes with a P-value of `r ans$p.value`

## 3. Overall Candy Rankings

> Q13. What are the five least liked candy types in this set?

There are two related functions that can help here, one is the classic `sort()` and `order()`

```{r}
x <- c(5,10,1,4)
sort(x)
order(x)
```
```{r}
inds <- order(candy$winpercent)
head(candy[inds,], 5)
```
The five least liked candy are Nik L Nip, Boston Baked Beans, Chiclets, Super Bubble, and Jawbusters.

> Q14. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?

```{r}
inds <- order(candy$winpercent, decreasing = T)
head(candy[inds,], 5)
```
The top five favorite candies are Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, Reese's Miniatures, Twix, Kit Kat, and Snickers.

Make a bar plot with ggplot and order it by winpercent values.
> Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, rownames(candy)) +
  geom_col()
```
> Q16. This is quite ugly, use the`reorder()` function to get the bars sorted by `winpercent`?

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col()
```

Here we want a custom color vector to color each bar the way we want - with chocolate and fruity candy together with whether is it a `bar` or not.

```{r}
my_cols <- rep("grey", nrow(candy))
my_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] <- "chocolate"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] <- "pink"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] <- "brown"

ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill=my_cols) 

ggsave("mybarplot.png", width = 3, height = 6)
```
![My silly barplot image](mybarplot.png)


> Now, for the first time, using this plot we can answer questions like:
> Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

Sixlets

> Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

Starburst

## 4. Taking a look at pricepoint

```{r}
# Pink and gray are too light, lets change to red and black
my_cols <- rep("black", nrow(candy))
my_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] <- "chocolate"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] <- "red"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] <- "brown"

library(ggrepel)

# How about a plot of price vs win
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) + 
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols, size=3.3, max.overlaps = 8)
```
> Q19. Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms of winpercent for the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your buck?

```{r}
ord <- order(candy$pricepercent, decreasing = TRUE)
tail( candy[ord,c(11,12)], n=5 )
```

> Q20. What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and of these which is the least popular?

```{r}
ord <- order(candy$pricepercent, decreasing = TRUE)
head( candy[ord,c(11,12)], n=5 )
```


## 5. Correlation Structure

```{r}
cij <- cor(candy)
cij
```

```{r}
library(corrplot)

corrplot(cij)
```
> Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?

Chocolate and fruity variables are anti-correlated.

```{r}
round( cij["chocolate", "fruity"], 2)
```


> Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?

Chocolate and bar are most positively correlated.
```{r}
round( cij["chocolate", "bar"], 2)
```

## 6. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

We need to be sure to scale our input `candy` data before PCA as we have `winpercent` column on a different scale to all others in the dataset.

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale = T)
summary(pca)
```
First main result figure is my "PCA plot"

```{r}
#pca$x

ggplot(pca$x) +
  aes(PC1, PC2, label = rownames(pca$x)) +
  geom_point(col = my_cols) +
  geom_text_repel(max.overlaps = 6, col = my_cols) +
  theme_bw()
```
The second main PCA result is in the `pca$rotation` we can plot this to generate a so-called "loadings" plot.
```{r}
#pca$rotation

ggplot(pca$rotation) +
  aes(PC1, rownames(pca$rotation)) +
  geom_col()
```
```{r}
ggplot(pca$rotation) +
  aes(PC1, reorder(rownames(pca$rotation), PC1), fill = PC1) +
  geom_col()
```

> Q24. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction? Do these make sense to you?

Fruity, hard, and pluribus variables are strongly picked up by PC1 in the positive direction. This makes sense because fruity candy are commonly found in a bag of multiple candies, and have a hard texture compared to other candies like chocolate.
