Now let’s look at a different population. I picked GBR.

``` r
gbr <- read.csv("373522-SampleGenotypes-Homo_sapiens_Variation_Sample_rs8067378.csv")
```

Find proportion of G\|G

``` r
round(table(gbr$Genotype..forward.strand.) / nrow(gbr) * 100, 2)
```


      A|A   A|G   G|A   G|G 
    25.27 18.68 26.37 29.67 

This variant that is associated with childhood asthma is more frequent
in the GBR population than the MKL population.

Lets now dig into this further.

# Section 4. Population Scale Analysis

One sample is obviously not enough to know what is happening in a
population. You are interested in assessing genetic differences on a
population scale. So, you processed about ~230 samples and did the
normalization on a genome level. Now, you want to find whether there is
any association of the 4 asthma-associated SNPs (rs8067378…) on ORMDL3
expression.

How many samples do we have?

``` r

```


    A/A A/G G/G

Median expression levels for each genotype:

> Q14: Generate a boxplot with a box per genotype, what could you infer
> from the relative expression value between A/A and G/G displayed in

``` r
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(expr) + 
  aes(geno, exp, fill = geno) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

![](class12_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)

G/G has a lower median and overall lower expression of the ORMDL3 gene
than A/A. This indicates that the SNP effects the expression of ORMDL3,
specifically the G allele in this location is associated with reduced
expression of the ORMDL3 gene.
